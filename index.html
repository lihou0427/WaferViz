- WaferViz is an open-source wafer data plotting software intended for semiconductor engineering community. 
- Currently major metrology tool vendors have their own platting programs embedded in their tools while some other apps have been used around are either license restricted or unavailable to general public.
- As a process engineer the author found there is a need of a free app for converting raw wafer data to presentable graphs especially for engineers in fabs where a plotting program is not readily accessible.
